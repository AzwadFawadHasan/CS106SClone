block vs inline display

1. block: large blocks of content, has height and width
<p>, <h1>, <blockquote>, <ol>, <ul>, <table>
2. inline: small amount of content, no height or width
<a>, <em>, <strong>,<br>
a. inline block: inline content with height and width
<img>
3. metadata: information about the page, usually not visible
<title>, <meta>



## Inline elements
Take up only as much width as 
needed (flows left to right)
- Cannot have height and width
- Cannot have a block element child
- Cannot be positioned (i.e. CSS 
properties like float and position
do not apply to inline elements)
○ Must position its containing block 
element instead

##  inline-block
 <img>, any element with 
display: inline-block;
- Width is the size of the content, i.e. 
it takes only as much space as 
needed (flows left to right)
- Can have height and width
- Can have a block element as a child
- Can be positioned (i.e. CSS 
properties like float and 
position apply)


## display property
You can change an element's default rendering type by changing 
the display property

## divs and spans
Two generic tags with no intended purpose or style:
● <div>: a generic block element
● <span>: a generic inline element

## css selectors

class -> .
id -> #
