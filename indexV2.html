            <p id="introDetails">CS 106S is a survey course on the applications of fundamental computer science concepts from CS 106B to problems in the social good space (such as health, government, education, and environment). Each week consists of in-class activities designed by student groups, local tech companies, and nonprofits. Some of the topics we will cover include mental health chatbots, tumor classification with basic machine learning, sentiment analysis of tweets on refugees, and the ethical obligation of good security. Recommended prerequisite/corequisite: CS 106B.</p>

            <p class="addWhite">Students are expected to attend class each week and participate in class lectures, discussions, and exercises. Every week will have a check-off form with some simple questions from class and feedback prompts for the teaching team; we leave time at the end of class for you to complete the check-off form (and we expect it to take no more than five minutes), and will close at 11:59pm the day of class. This will be the way we check your attendance.</p>
